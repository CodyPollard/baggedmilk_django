		  <p>Milk-bot is a project I started to play with the discord.py API and add some flavor to my Discord server. Current features include:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Quotes command to display a random quote from the list or a random quote from a given author. This includes the ability to add quotes directly from the discord server.</li>
		  	<li>Magic 8ball for all those times you don't have a coin to flip on hand.</li>
		  	<li>Shopping list command to add/remove and display a list of items.</li>
		  	<li>Various small house cleaning and administrative commands.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The project is hosted on github <a href="https://github.com/CodyPollard/milk-bot">here</a>. Milk-bot uses
		  MongoDB to handle user profiles in order to limit and track access to other commands used with the bot. This
		  includes the ability to limit command usage on a per user basis and track/display which commands a person
		  uses the most.</p>
