		  <hr>
		  <p>Milk-bot is a project I started to play with the discord.py API and add some flavor to our group's Discord server. Current features include:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Quotes command to display a random quote from the list or a random quote from a given author. This includes the ability to add quotes directly from the discord server.</li>
		  	<li>Magic 8ball for all those times you don't have a coin to flip on hand.</li>
		  	<li>Shopping list command to add/remove and display a list of items.</li>
		  	<li>CoC game currently in the works but unfinished and not in a playable state.</li>
		  	<li>Various small house cleaning and administrative commands.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>For more information on how to add milk-bot to your server or any questions related to the various features feel free to <a href="https://discord.gg/sgs2neA">join our Discord</a>.</p>
