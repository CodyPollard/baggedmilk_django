		  <h1>Bagged Milk</h1>
		  <p>Welcome to my own personal testing ground. Current projects include an Overbuff web scraper and a rebuilding of a browser game called <a href="http:\\www.kingsofchaos.com">Kings of Chaos</a>. My goal is to add any in-progress or finished projects to the top bar until I run out of space. I also wrote a couple articles for <a href="https://imperium.news/author/codypollard/">Imperium News</a> about EVE Online but that's probably not that interesting.</p>
